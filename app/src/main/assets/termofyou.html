<h3>
    Drop In Terms of Service
</h3>

<p>
    October 29, 2015
</p>

<p>
    This following user agreement describes the terms and conditions on which Drop In, Inc. offers
    you access to the Drop In Program.
</p>

<p>
    Welcome to the user agreement (the "<b>Agreement</b>" or "<b>Terms of Service</b>") for Drop In
    (the "<b>Drop In Program</b>"), an application owned and operated by Drop In, Inc., a Delaware
    corporation. This Agreement is a legally binding agreement made between you ("<b>You</b>," "<b>Your</b>,"
    or "<b>Yourself</b>") and Drop In, Inc. ("<b>Drop In</b>," "<b>We</b>," "<b>Us</b>" or
    "<b>Our</b>").
</p>

<p>
    Drop In is willing to license the Drop In Program to You only upon the condition that You accept
    all the terms contained in this Agreement. By signing up with or by using the Drop In Program,
    You indicate that You understand this Agreement and accept all of its terms. If You do not
    accept all the terms of this Agreement, then Drop In is unwilling to license the Drop In Program
    to You and You should not use the Program.
</p>

<p>
    The Drop In Program provides a means to enable persons who seek assistance in viewing a live
    video and audio stream of a location or event that they are interested in but unable to visit or
    attend ("<b>Users</b>") to be matched with persons ("<b>Operators</b>") willing to assist with
    obtaining the live video and audio footage of such location or event (the "<b>Video Content</b>")
    through the use of their cellular phones and other applicable devices and any other services
    that may be available from time to time. For purposes of this Agreement, these services shall
    collectively be defined as the "<b>Services</b>." This Agreement describes the terms and
    conditions that will govern Your use of and participation in the Drop In Program.
</p>

<p>
    Please read this Agreement carefully before using the Services. You must read, agree with, and
    accept all of the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, which includes those terms
    and conditions expressly set out below and those incorporated by reference, before You use any
    of the Services. By using any of the Services, You become a Participant in Drop In and a User of
    Services available on the Drop In Program ("<b>Participant</b>") and You agree to be bound by
    the terms and conditions of this Agreement with respect to such Services.
</p>

<p>
    If You do not agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, please do not use
    or access Drop In or register for the services provided on Drop In. We may amend this Agreement
    at any time by posting the amended terms on the Drop In Program. If We post amended terms on the
    Drop In Program, You may not use the Services without accepting them. Except as stated below,
    all amended terms shall automatically be effective after they are posted on the Drop In Program.
    This Agreement may not be otherwise amended except in writing signed by You and Drop In.
</p>

<p>
    Drop In does not provide video services or film production services, and Drop In is not a
    production company. It is up to the Operator to decide whether or not to offer to obtain and
    provide the video footage as requested through the Drop In Program, and it is up User to decide
    whether or not to accept the Service from any Operator contacted through the Drop In Program.
    Any decision by a User to offer or accept the Services once such User is matched through the
    Drop In Program is a decision made in such User's sole discretion. Drop In offers information
    and a method to connect Operators and Users with each other, but does not and does not intend to
    provide video or film services or act in any manner as a production company and has no
    responsibility or liability for any video services voluntarily provided to any User by any
    Operator using the Drop In Program.
</p>

<p>
    This paragraph applies to any version of the Drop In Program that you acquire from the Apple App
    Store. This Agreement is entered into between You and Drop In. Apple, Inc. ("<b>Apple</b>") is
    not a party to this Agreement and shall have no obligations with respect to the Drop In Program.
    Drop In, not Apple, is solely responsible for the Drop In Program and the content thereof as set
    forth hereunder. However, Apple and Apple's subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of this
    Agreement. Upon Your acceptance of this Agreement, Apple shall have the right (and will be
    deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against You as a third party
    beneficiary thereof. This Agreement incorporates by reference the Licensed Application End User
    License Agreement published by Apple, for purposes of which, You are "the end-user." In the
    event of a conflict in the terms of the Licensed Application End User License Agreement and this
    Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control.

<h4>Payments</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <span class="underline">Charges</span>. You understand that use of the Services may
            result in charges to you for the services or goods you receive from an Operator ("<b>Charges</b>").
            After you have received services or goods obtained through your use of the Service, Drop
            In will facilitate your payment of the applicable Charges on behalf of the Operator, as
            such Operator’s limited payment collection agent. Payment of the Charges in such manner
            shall be considered the same as payment made directly by you to the Operator. Charges
            will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Charges paid by you are
            final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Us. Drop In reserves the right
            to determine pricing.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <span class="underline">Payment Terms</span>. All Charges are due immediately and
            payment will be facilitated by Drop In using the preferred payment method designated in
            your account, after which Drop In will send you a receipt by email. If your primary
            account payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be
            charged, you agree that We may, as the Operator’s limited payment collection agent, use
            a secondary payment method in your account, if available.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <span class="underline">Refunds and Higher Charges</span>. All payments made are
            non-refundable, subject to Our discretion. As between You and Drop In, Drop In reserves
            the right to establish, remove and/or revise Charges for any or all services or goods
            obtained through the use of the Services at any time in Drop In's sole discretion.
            Further, You acknowledge and agree that Charges applicable in certain geographical areas
            may increase substantially during times of high demand. We will use reasonable efforts
            to inform you of Charges that may apply, provided that you will be responsible for
            Charges incurred under your Account.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <span class="underline">Promotional Offers</span>. Drop In, at its sole discretion, may
            make available promotional offers with different features to any of our customers. These
            promotional offers, unless made to You, shall have no bearing whatsoever on Your offer
            or contract.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <span class="underline">Cancellation Fee</span>. You may elect to cancel your request
            for Services from an Operator before the start of the Services; provided, however, if a
            User cancels a video request on the Drop In Program more than 10 minutes after such
            request is made, User agrees to pay a “Cancellation Fee” of $<b>5.00</b>.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <span class="underline">Payment Structure</span>. This payment structure is intended to
            fully compensate the Operator for the Services provided. Drop In does not designate any
            portion of your payment as a tip or gratuity to the Operator. Any representation by Us
            (on Our website, in the Application, or in Our marketing materials) to the effect that
            tipping is "voluntary," "not required," and/or "included" in the payments you make for
            services or goods provided is not intended to suggest that Drop In provides any
            additional amounts, beyond those described above, to the Operator. You understand and
            agree that, while you are free to provide additional payment as a gratuity to any
            Operator who provides you with goods or services obtained through the Service, you are
            under no obligation to do so. Gratuities are voluntary and would not be processed
            through Us. After you have received services or goods obtained through the Service, you
            will have the opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional feedback about
            your Operator.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <span class="underline">Charges</span>. You understand that use of the Services may
            result in charges to you for the services or goods you receive from an Operator ("<b>Charges</b>").
            After you have received services or goods obtained through your use of the Service, Drop
            In will facilitate your payment of the applicable Charges on behalf of the Operator, as
            such Operator's limited payment collection agent. Payment of the Charges in such manner
            shall be considered the same as payment made directly by you to the Operator. Charges
            will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Charges paid by you are
            final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Us. Drop In reserves the right
            to determine pricing.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <span class="underline">Facilitation of Payments</span>. All Charges, as applicable,
            shall be facilitated through Drop In’s third-party payment processing service.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<!--<h4>
    Insurance  [To be discussed]
</h4>
<p>
    Drop In procures an insurance policy that provides Operators with excess automobile liability insurance up to $______  per occurrence.  The policy offers excess liability protection over an Operator's existing insurance while such Operator is traveling to a location or event to provide Services arranged through the Drop In Program.  The policy coverage is limited to liability only and does not provide coverage for collision, comprehensive or wear and tear damage to an Operator's vehicle.  As with any automobile insurance policy, additional insurance terms, limitations, and exclusions apply.
</p>
<p>
    This is an unofficial summary of Drop In's master insurance policy and may not always be up-to-date. None of the statements in this section should be interpreted as binding and are provided for quick reference only.

    credit card or accepted payment partner). You agree to maintain accurate, complete, and
    up-to-date information in your Account. Your failure to maintain accurate, complete, and
    up-to-date Account information, including having an invalid or expired payment method on file,

    Accounts You choose and subject to the privacy settings that You have set in such Third Party
    Accounts, personally identifiable information that You post to Your Third Party Accounts may be
    available on and through the Drop In Program. Please note that if a Third Party Account or
    associated service becomes unavailable or the Drop In Program's access to such Third Party
    Account is terminated by the third party service provider, then SNS Content may no longer be
    available on and through the Drop In Program. Please note that your relationship with the third
    party service providers associated with your third party accounts is governed solely by your
    agreement(s) with such third party service providers. Drop In makes no effort to review any SNS

    non-infringement, and Drop In is not responsible for any SNS Content.

    participate as a plaintiff or class in any purported class action or representative proceeding.

    consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any
    class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the
    entirety of this "Dispute Resolution" section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the
    preceding sentence, this "Dispute Resolution" section will survive any termination of this
    Agreement.
</p>

<p>
    The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("<b>AAA</b>") in
    accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer
    Related Disputes (the "<b>AAA Rules</b>") then in effect, except as modified by this "Dispute
    Resolution" section. (The AAA Rules are available at <a href="www.adr.org/arb_med"

    interpretation and enforcement of this section.
</p>

<p>
    If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the
    basis of documents you and Drop In submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the
    arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to
    a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will
    have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent
    with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
</p>

<p>
    The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The
    arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the
    arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having
    jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator's award damages must be consistent with the terms of the
    "Limitation of Liability" section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a
    party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in
    favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the
    claimant's individual claim. The prevailing party in the arbitration will be entitled to an
    award of attorneys' fees and expenses. Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative
    and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.

    As used in this Policy, the term "Personal Information" means information which is specific to
    you and which might, potentially, allow a third-party to discover your identity, your financial
    affairs, your geographical location, and the types of activities you have engaged in when using
    the Drop In Services. This Personal Information includes matters such as your actual name, your
    address, your credit card information, your e-mail address, phone number, and other specific
    information which could identify you and your activities. For obvious reasons, we need to
    collect some of this personal information in order to open your initial account with Drop In,
    and to provide you with a password to protect your information. We will also use your Personal
    Information to communicate with you, to provide you with improved and personalized service, and
    to facilitate our billing you for our Services. The Drop In application also includes a GPS
    element. We may use the GPS locater if we need to physically locate you; for example, if we
    needed to deliver items to you under certain circumstances.
</p>

<p>
    You should also know that some of your Personal Information, such as the type and frequency of
    the Services we provide to you, is automatically generated and stored by the Drop In application
    during the process of our providing Services to you, the Participant.
</p>
<h4>
    When Is Your Personal Information Shared With Other Parties ?
</h4>

<p>
    We only share your Personal Information with other persons and entities for the purpose of
    providing you with quality and reliable Services, in order to allow us to communicate with you
    and vice versa, and to conduct financial transactions with you when necessary. We will also use
    your Personal Information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver and improve the Services
    provided to you, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes. We may also use your Personal
    Information, including your date of birth, to verify your identity and to prevent the fraudulent
    or unauthorized use of your Drop In account. From time to time, we may also use your Personal
    Information to send you notices, such as communications about your account and any changes to
    our Terms of Service.
</p>

<p>
    In order to accomplish these things, we may share your Personal Information with:


</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Our company's employees and affiliates.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Our trusted business partners that provide their services to us, and enable us to provide
            our Services to you.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Other than the foregoing, our policy is to keep your Personal Information strictly confidential
    and unavailable to third parties. We will never sell, exchange, or trade your Personal
    Information to an outside third party for purposes of their marketing or trying to sell you
    other goods and services.
</p>

<p>
    A possible and rare exception to our practice of keeping your Personal Information confidential
    would be the situation where we are served with a subpoena or comparable court order, which
    legally requires us to disclose some or all of your Personal Information to a court or other
    government agency. In these rare cases, we are required to comply with the law and provide the
    information; however, if this happens we will attempt to contact you to advise you of the
    pending disclosure.
</p>
<h4>
    What About Non-Personal Information ?
</h4>

<p>
    In the course of our providing Services to you, the Participant, the Drop In application and
    software systems will automatically collect and store some of your Non-Personal Information. As
    used in this Policy, "Non-Personal Information" refers to information about you and your use of
    our Services which will not, on its own, allow a third party to connect the information with any
    specific individual. In other words, the disclosure of your Non-Personal Information will not,
    on its own, enable an outside person to discover anything about your identity, your financial
    affairs, your contact information, or the Services which you have requested or obtained from the
    Drop-In application.
</p>

<p>
    Because your Non-Personal Information cannot be identified with you or your personal affairs, we
    may collect, use, transfer and disclose the Non-Personal Information for any purpose. The
    following are some examples of the types of Non-Personal Information that we collect, and how we
    may use it:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>We may collect information such as your occupation, your primary language, your zip code,
            and the general geographical area where you use our Services, so that we can develop
            statistical models to better understand our Participant's needs, behavior, and the type
            of Services needed.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>We may collect Non-Personal Information regarding your activities and search queries on
            our website. This information is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful
            information to our customers, and to understand which Services and features on our
            website are most interesting and/or useful to you.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Additionally, we may aggregate the above Non-Personal Information in order help our
            application developers improve their apps.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Personal Information will generally not be combined with Non-Personal Information for the
            above purposes. In the event that we do combine Personal Information with Non-Personal
            Information, all of the combined information will be treated as confidential.</p>
    </li>
</ul>


<h4>
    How Secure Is Your Personal Information ?
</h4>

<p>
    Our servers are located in a secure service facility. All of your Personal Information,
    including your credit card information, is encrypted and password protected. Consequently, only
    you and authorized Drop In employees will have access to your account and Personal Information.
</p>

<p>
    Having said this, it is an unfortunate fact that no security system is absolutely impenetrable
    and therefore we cannot absolutely guarantee the security of our database. Since no data which
    is transmitted over the internet can be guaranteed to remain 100% secure, Drop In cannot make
    any warranty or representation that the information submitted by you will never be manipulated,
    or viewed by outside third parties who are not associated with Drop In.
</p>

<p>
    This Privacy Policy applies to any Personal Information and Non-Personal Information which you
    provide to us, regardless of whether is provided in the form of written or printed material, or
    through data input on a computer, mobile phone, tablet, or any other type of electronic device.
</p>
<h4>
    The Scope And Application Of This Privacy Policy.
</h4>

<p>
    This Privacy Policy only applies to the Personal Information and Non-Personal Information which
    you provide to us, or which we collect as described above. The Privacy Policy does not apply to
    the live video and audio footage which you may acquire through the use of the Drop In
    application (the "Video Content"). As stated in the Drop In Terms of Service Agreement, which is
    being provided to you concurrently, you will be the owner of the Video Content purchased through
    the Drop In program; however, Drop In has a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and royalty-free
    right to use, copy, perform, display and exploit this Video Content. For further details on
    this, please consult the Terms of Service Agreement.
</p>

<p>
    This Privacy Policy will apply to any User who opens an account with Drop In and/or uses the
    Drop In application or any of our other Services. By opening an account and using the Drop In
    Services, you are agreeing with and accepting all the terms and conditions of this Privacy
    Policy. If you do not agree with the terms and conditions of our Privacy Policy then you should
    not use Drop In's Services. Your participation in the Drop In program is totally voluntary.
</p>
<h4>
    Cookies.
</h4>

<p>
    Like most internet services, Drop In uses "cookies" in connection with providing its Services. A
    cookie is a small parcel of information stored on your hard drive. This technology allows Drop
    In to gather information regarding your use of our Services and store it in our own database.
    Most of the information gathered through the use of cookies is Non-Personal Information which we
    aggregate and use to understand our Users' behavior patterns and measure the effectiveness of
    our application. If any of your Personal Information is collected through the use of our
    cookies, we will treat this as confidential Personal Information.
</p>
<h4>
    Third-Party Sites And Services.
</h4>

<p>
    After acquiring any Video Content through the use of our Services, you may wish to transfer this
    content, or post it on a third-party site; e.g., YouTube, Facebook, etc. Once you have
    transferred or posted your Video Content to such a third-party site, it is no longer under
    Drop-In's control and our Privacy Policy can no longer apply or be enforced. Instead, the use of
    your Video Content will then be governed by the privacy practices of the other site. You should
    familiarize yourself with the privacy policies of those third-party sites.
</p>
<h4>
    Information About Minors.
</h4>

<p>
    It is the policy of Drop In that we do not knowingly collect, store, disclose or transmit
    Personal Information involving children under the age of 18. If it comes to our attention that
    we have collected Personal Information about a child under the age of 18, we will delete this
    information unless we are requested to do otherwise by written consent from the child's parents
    or guardians.
</p>
<h4>
    Changes In The Privacy Policy.
</h4>

<p>
    Drop In retains the right to change the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy at any time.
    If any material change is made in this Privacy Policy, you will receive a notification of the
    change from us by e-mail or comparable means, and we will also post a notice of the change on
    our website. Once you have been notified of the change in our Privacy Policy, your continued use
    of our Services shall constitute your agreement with, and acceptance of, the new terms and
    conditions of the Privacy Policy.
